# Backend Engineer Take Home Challenge

Our team at Justworks values iterative problem solving and is very intentional about our process of building software to ensure we solve customer problems. Throughout our interview process we want you to get a good understanding of how we approach engineering problems and what it is like to work with us.

Instead of a live coding exercise where you’re asked to solve an algorithmic teaser in a high-pressure, time limited situation, which is not representative of how we work, we instead have prepared this take home challenge. We will discuss your submission and expand on it during the next round of your interview process.

## Guidelines

- This is meant to be an assignment in which you spend approximately 3 hours of dedicated, focused work. We are trying to get insight as to how you practice your craft as a software engineer. Index towards quality of implementation rather than quantity.
- Choose the programming language you are most comfortable with to solve this challenge. If you consider yourself fluent in multiple programming languages and need some help deciding, we have a bias towards interpreted languages such as Ruby, Python, or Javascript.
- You are free to use any public or open source libraries you wish.
- We want this sample to be representative of day to day work so there’s no extra credit for writing from memory. Feel free to consult Stack Overflow or any documentation that helps you deliver a solution as often as you need.
- Use the README to document your thought process and any decisions you’ve made. If you run out of time, please indicate where you’ve left off and explain how you would have approached the remaining tasks.

## The Problem

We are designing and building an online restaurant reservation system for a popular restaurant in Manhattan. Restaurants operate on thin margins and they rely on reservation system info to help accurately plan and optimize their food and ingredients purchases. Our service will help them do that.

The only requirements for this assignment are:


1. Create an API endpoint for creating reservations that allows the API consumer to specify the following attributes:
    1. party size
    1. reservation date
    1. reservation slot
    1. party name
    1. contact phone
    1. contact email address.
2. Create an API endpoint for listing all reservations at the restaurant. The API consumer should be able to filter based on reservation attributes:
    1. party size
    1. reservation date
    1. reservation slot
    1. party name
    1. contact phone
    1. contact email address
3. Provide documentation that describes how to build and run your code, and include sample API payloads.

Feel free to solve this challenge in a way that best demonstrates your expertise and creativity. The ideal way to submit this project is as a public GitHub repository as this makes managing access easier. Please share the link with us by email 36 hours before your Round 2 so that we have enough time to review your submission. If you are unable or uncomfortable with using a public git repository, you can share a private GitHub repository with the user handle @joinjustworksptu. You can also share a zip of your git repository to us via email.

Good luck!
